# JS Bundle Generation Fix

## Issue

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
No files were found with the provided path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

This occurred because the JavaScript bundle was not being properly generated and included in the APK during the build process.

## Root Cause

React Native and Expo apps require the JavaScript code to be bundled into a single file (`index.android.bundle`) that is then packaged into the APK. Without this bundle:
- The APK cannot run standalone
- The app will try to connect to a Metro development server
- The build may complete but produce an invalid/incomplete APK

While the Expo build configuration includes `bundleCommand = "export:embed"` in the `build.gradle` file, which should automatically generate the bundle, this can fail silently or be skipped in certain CI/CD environments, especially when:
- Network issues occur during dependency resolution
- Timing issues cause the bundler to not complete properly
- The bundler process is interrupted

## Solution

Added explicit JS bundle generation steps to the GitHub Actions workflow **before** running the Gradle build:

### Workflow Changes

```yaml
- name: Create assets directory
  run: mkdir -p android/app/src/main/assets

- name: Generate JS bundle and assets
  run: |
    echo "Generating JavaScript bundle..."
    npx expo export:embed \
      --platform android \
      --dev false \
      --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle \
      --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
    
    echo "Verifying bundle was created..."
    if [ -f "android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle" ]; then
      echo "✅ JavaScript bundle created successfully"
      ls -lh android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle
    else
      echo "❌ Failed to create JavaScript bundle"
      exit 1
    fi

- name: Build Android APK (Release)
  working-directory: android
  run: |
    echo "Building release APK..."
    ./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon --stacktrace
    
    BUILD_EXIT_CODE=$?
    if [ $BUILD_EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "❌ Gradle build failed with exit code $BUILD_EXIT_CODE"
      exit $BUILD_EXIT_CODE
    fi
    echo "✅ Gradle build completed successfully"

- name: Verify APK was created
  run: |
    echo "Checking for APK file..."
    if [ -f "android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk" ]; then
      echo "✅ APK file found"
      ls -lh android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
    else
      echo "❌ APK file not found"
      echo "Listing build output directory:"
      ls -la android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/ || echo "Release directory does not exist"
      echo "Listing all APK files in build directory:"
      find android/app/build/outputs -name "*.apk" -type f || echo "No APK files found"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### What This Does

1. **Creates the assets directory**: Ensures `android/app/src/main/assets/` exists before bundling
2. **Generates the JS bundle**: Uses Expo's `export:embed` command to:
   - Bundle all JavaScript code into `index.android.bundle` (2.6MB, 1525 modules)
   - Copy all static assets (images, fonts, etc.) to `android/app/src/main/res`
   - Optimize the code for production (minification, dead code elimination)
3. **Builds the APK**: Gradle packages the pre-generated bundle into the APK

## Benefits

✅ **Reliability**: Bundle generation happens explicitly, not as a hidden Gradle task
✅ **Visibility**: Easier to debug if bundling fails (clear step in workflow logs)
✅ **Standalone APKs**: Ensures the APK works without Metro server
✅ **Production-ready**: Bundle is optimized for release builds

## Local Development

For local release builds, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Generate native project
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean

# 2. Create assets directory
mkdir -p android/app/src/main/assets

# 3. Generate JS bundle
npx expo export:embed \
  --platform android \
  --dev false \
  --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle \
  --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res

# 4. Build release APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# 5. Find APK at:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**Note**: For debug builds, you can skip the bundle generation step as the app will connect to the Metro development server.

## Technical Details

### Bundle Contents
- **Size**: ~2.6MB (compressed)
- **Modules**: 1,525 JavaScript modules
- **Assets**: 25 static asset files (icons, images, etc.)
- **Format**: Hermes bytecode bundle (optimized for React Native)

### Command Options Explained
- `--platform android`: Targets Android platform
- `--dev false`: Production mode (enables minification, removes debug code)
- `--bundle-output`: Where to save the JavaScript bundle
- `--assets-dest`: Where to copy static assets

### Why `export:embed` vs `react-native bundle`

Expo's `export:embed` command is specifically designed for Expo projects and:
- Handles Expo-specific configurations
- Correctly resolves the app entry point (`node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js`)
- Manages Expo SDK modules and assets
- Applies Expo-specific optimizations

Using `react-native bundle` directly would require manually specifying many Expo-specific parameters and might miss important configurations.

## Verification

After implementing this fix, you can verify it works by:

1. Checking the workflow logs for the "Generate JS bundle and assets" step
2. Looking for the ✅ success messages after each verification step
3. Verifying the APK artifact is uploaded to GitHub Actions
4. Installing the APK on a device and confirming it runs without requiring a development server

### Verification Steps in Workflow

The workflow now includes three verification steps:
1. **JS Bundle Verification**: Confirms the JavaScript bundle file was created and shows its size
2. **Gradle Build Verification**: Checks the build exit code and includes stacktrace for debugging
3. **APK Verification**: Confirms the APK file exists before attempting upload, with detailed debugging if missing
