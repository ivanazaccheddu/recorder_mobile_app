# JS Bundle Generation Fix

## Issue

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
No files were found with the provided path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk
```

This occurred because the JavaScript bundle was not being properly generated and included in the APK during the build process.

## Root Cause

React Native and Expo apps require the JavaScript code to be bundled into a single file (`index.android.bundle`) that is then packaged into the APK. Without this bundle:
- The APK cannot run standalone
- The app will try to connect to a Metro development server
- The build may complete but produce an invalid/incomplete APK

While the Expo build configuration includes `bundleCommand = "export:embed"` in the `build.gradle` file, which should automatically generate the bundle, this can fail silently or be skipped in certain CI/CD environments, especially when:
- Network issues occur during dependency resolution
- Timing issues cause the bundler to not complete properly
- The bundler process is interrupted

## Solution

Added explicit JS bundle generation steps to the GitHub Actions workflow **before** running the Gradle build:

### Workflow Changes

```yaml
- name: Create assets directory
  run: mkdir -p android/app/src/main/assets

- name: Generate JS bundle and assets
  run: |
    npx expo export:embed \
      --platform android \
      --dev false \
      --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle \
      --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res

- name: Build Android APK (Release)
  working-directory: android
  run: ./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

### What This Does

1. **Creates the assets directory**: Ensures `android/app/src/main/assets/` exists before bundling
2. **Generates the JS bundle**: Uses Expo's `export:embed` command to:
   - Bundle all JavaScript code into `index.android.bundle` (2.6MB, 1525 modules)
   - Copy all static assets (images, fonts, etc.) to `android/app/src/main/res`
   - Optimize the code for production (minification, dead code elimination)
3. **Builds the APK**: Gradle packages the pre-generated bundle into the APK

## Benefits

✅ **Reliability**: Bundle generation happens explicitly, not as a hidden Gradle task
✅ **Visibility**: Easier to debug if bundling fails (clear step in workflow logs)
✅ **Standalone APKs**: Ensures the APK works without Metro server
✅ **Production-ready**: Bundle is optimized for release builds

## Local Development

For local release builds, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Generate native project
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean

# 2. Create assets directory
mkdir -p android/app/src/main/assets

# 3. Generate JS bundle
npx expo export:embed \
  --platform android \
  --dev false \
  --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle \
  --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res

# 4. Build release APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# 5. Find APK at:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk
```

**Note**: For debug builds, you can skip the bundle generation step as the app will connect to the Metro development server.

## Technical Details

### Bundle Contents
- **Size**: ~2.6MB (compressed)
- **Modules**: 1,525 JavaScript modules
- **Assets**: 25 static asset files (icons, images, etc.)
- **Format**: Hermes bytecode bundle (optimized for React Native)

### Command Options Explained
- `--platform android`: Targets Android platform
- `--dev false`: Production mode (enables minification, removes debug code)
- `--bundle-output`: Where to save the JavaScript bundle
- `--assets-dest`: Where to copy static assets

### Why `export:embed` vs `react-native bundle`

Expo's `export:embed` command is specifically designed for Expo projects and:
- Handles Expo-specific configurations
- Correctly resolves the app entry point (`node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js`)
- Manages Expo SDK modules and assets
- Applies Expo-specific optimizations

Using `react-native bundle` directly would require manually specifying many Expo-specific parameters and might miss important configurations.

## Verification

After implementing this fix, you can verify it works by:

1. Checking the workflow logs for the "Generate JS bundle and assets" step
2. Ensuring the bundle generation completes successfully
3. Verifying the APK artifact is uploaded to GitHub Actions
4. Installing the APK on a device and confirming it runs without requiring a development server
