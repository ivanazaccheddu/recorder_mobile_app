## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Component Structure

- Use functional components with hooks
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Keep components in appropriate directories
- Export components from index files

### State Management

- Use Context API for global state
- Use local state for component-specific state
- Keep state as minimal as possible
