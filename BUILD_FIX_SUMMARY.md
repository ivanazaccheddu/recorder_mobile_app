# Android Build Fix Summary

## Issue
GitHub Actions workflow for Android build was failing with Gradle/Kotlin plugin compatibility errors.

## Root Cause
Expo SDK 50 had known compatibility issues with:
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.1
- Gradle 8.3
- The expo-modules-core plugin system

This manifested as two main errors:
1. `Could not find method android()` - Kotlin plugin couldn't properly apply Android configuration
2. `Could not get unknown property 'release'` - Software component registration issue

## Solution
Upgraded to Expo SDK 51, which includes:
- Better Gradle 8.8 support
- Updated Android Gradle Plugin 8.2.1
- Improved expo-modules-core plugin system
- React Native 0.74.5 with better build tooling

## Technical Changes

### Dependencies
- **Expo SDK**: 50.0.17 → 51.0.39
- **React Native**: 0.73.6 → 0.74.5
- **Gradle**: 8.3 → 8.8
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.1.1 → 8.2.1
- **Kotlin**: 1.8.10 → 1.9.23
- **NDK**: 25.1.8937393 → 26.1.10909125

All expo-* packages were updated to their SDK 51 compatible versions.

### Code Changes
The `src/storage/database.ts` file was completely refactored to use the new expo-sqlite API:

**Before (SDK 50 - Callback API)**:
```typescript
const db = SQLite.openDatabase(DATABASE_NAME);
db.transaction((tx) => {
  tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM table', [], (_, { rows }) => {
    // Process results
  });
});
```

**After (SDK 51 - Async API)**:
```typescript
const db = await SQLite.openDatabaseAsync(DATABASE_NAME);
const rows = await db.getAllAsync('SELECT * FROM table');
// Process rows directly
```

## Validation
✅ All checks pass:
- Type checking: `npm run type-check` ✓
- Unit tests: `npm test` ✓
- Linting: `npm run lint` ✓
- Prebuild: `npx expo prebuild --platform android` ✓

## GitHub Actions Impact
The workflow has been updated to build production releases:
1. Install updated dependencies via `npm ci`
2. Pass all quality checks (type-check, tests, lint)
3. Generate Android project with `npx expo prebuild`
4. Generate JS bundle and assets with `npx expo export:embed`
5. Build release APK with `./gradlew assembleRelease`

## Expected Outcome
The Android build will now complete successfully, producing a release APK (unsigned) that can be downloaded as a GitHub Actions artifact named `app-release`.

## Breaking Changes
Only one breaking change affects the codebase:
- **expo-sqlite API** changed from callbacks to async/await
- All database operations in `database.ts` were updated
- No changes needed in other files

## Migration Notes
For developers pulling this update:
1. Delete `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Delete `android/` and `ios/` directories (they're regenerated)
4. Run `npx expo prebuild` if testing locally

## Latest Update: SDK 54

The project has been further upgraded to Expo SDK 54 (January 2025) with additional improvements:
- **Expo SDK**: 51.0.39 → 54.0.12
- **React**: 18.2.0 → 19.1.0
- **React Native**: 0.74.5 → 0.81.4
- **CI/CD**: Now builds release APKs instead of debug builds

See `UPGRADE_TO_SDK54.md` for details on the latest upgrade.
